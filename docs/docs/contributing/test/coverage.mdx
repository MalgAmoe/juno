We use [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) for coverage

# Installation

Install the [courtney](https://github.com/DemerzelSolutions/courtney) command-line tool to check configuration validity.

```bash
make install-courtney
```

## Execution

For coverage generation:

```bash
make codecov-test
```

To display locally coverage tests:

```bash
go tool cover -html=coverage/coverage.out
```
