We currently do not provide binaries for Juno, so you must use Go to retrieve and install it in your machine.

# Prerequisites

- [Clang](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) latest version.
- A Linux or Mac OS X machine.

# Installation

The Juno package presents two different tools that are made available to users through Golang:

```shell
go install github.com/NethermindEth/juno/cmd/juno@latest
```

Install all dependencies running the following command:

```shell
$ go get ./...
```
