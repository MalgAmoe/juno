Currently, we do not provide binaries for Juno, so you must use Golang to retrieve it.

# Prerequisites

- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) version 1.18.
- [Clang](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases) latest version.

## **Windows**
The best way to run Juno from a Windows machine currently is to use the WSL with Ubuntu:

1. Open Administrator Windows Power shell
2. wsl --install -d Ubuntu


# Installation

The Juno package presents two different tools that are made available to users through Golang:

```shell
go install github.com/NethermindEth/juno/cmd/juno@latest
```

Install all dependencies running the following command:

```shell
$ go get ./...
```
