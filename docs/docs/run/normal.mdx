To compile and run juno directly, you can use the `make all` command within the project directory.

```bash
make all
```

Alternatively, to compile the tools (`juno` and `juno-cli`) separately, simply run the `make compile` command within the project directory:

```bash
make compile
```

You will then have 2 available commands, generated inside the `build` folder of the project:

```bash
./build/juno # To start the node, or configure it.
./build/juno-cli # For utilities related to the StarkNet network
```

To run Juno, then:

```bash
make run
